# Exploring Spotify

> Dipping my toes into the ice cold waters of coding in the open

## Intro
I don't really know a lot about how APIs work, specifically online APIs used to access and share data between parties. I know they're very important, and I know what they are in an _offline_ sense, but they're not something I've had to study in relation to my formal study, nor are they something I've had much time to explore in an extracurricular sense. Most of my time has been spent learning the ins and outs of C# and Python language features but I'm bored of that now and I want to start making cool things.

Given the extent to which APIs are used (i.e. _everywhere_), this is my first attempt at trying to fix this glaring oversight. I love listening to music on spotify, and I love Autechre, and I've heard so many very good things from a lot of people I admire about how great the Spotify documentation is that it seems like an excellent place to start. This is also my first attempt at "coding in the open", a nerve-wracking prospect, but something I should probably get used to if I want to work in this field.

Expect some not too great code and some less than stellar interpretation/understanding of the things I'm doing. I'm a bit new, so if you happen to stumble over this and have some feedback then _please_ feel free to chime in and give us a hand.

## Why
The reason for all this is that I want to learn how to interact with Spotify such that I can create and manipulate playlists based on some given criteria; the first 'thing' I want to make is a script, an app, whatever, that can extract a list of albums from my weekly [Release Radar](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbfRgwzqHa6ro?si=11cd440dff38414c) playlist and put those complete albums into another playlist. It's great that RR exists and I've discovered a lot of new music from it, but it's annoying that the tracks Spotify chooses to populate the playlist (of course, it's never really a "choice" per-se) often aren't the best representation of these albums as a whole, or even the best tracks. Ultimately, it's far more enjoyable to listen to a playlist of complete albums and singles rather than a bunch of tracks based on some mysterious criteria.

Personal projects aside I'm also preparing myself for the coming academic year. I've elected to take a module in Internet Scripting which is ASP.NET focused (hopefully core, not framework) and so I should get into the habit of coding for the internet rather than simply coding for localhost.

## Learns
This has been a useful exercise in figuring out gaps in my knowledge base, or perhaps more precisely, gaps in my programming knowledge base - how the theoretical, abstract knowledge I've gained over the last year can be applied in a practical sense. 

The best example of this is in relation to HTTP: I've been finding that the most difficult aspect has been working with API documentation and figuring out what needs to go where, when, why, and how to construct things like endpoint requests and headers. This is all content I've covered as part of CCNA study, but speaks to a lack of understanding when it comes to the ins and outs of HTTP in a practical sense. I'm thinking about picking up a copy of [HTTP/2 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/http2-in-action). Hopefully, alongside more practical work like this, will allow me to become more familiar with the tech from a practical standpoint.
