# Exploring Spotify

> Dipping my toes into the ice cold waters of coding in the open!

I don't really know a lot about how APIs work, specifically online APIs used to access and share data between parties. I know they're very important, and I know what they are in an _offline_ sense, but they're not something I've had to study in relation to my formal study, nor are they something I've had much time to explore in an extracurricular sense. Most of my time has been spent learning the ins and outs of C# and Python language features but I'm bored of that now and I want to start making cool things.

Given the extent to which APIs are used (i.e. _everywhere_), this is my first attempt at trying to fix this glaring oversight. I love listening to music on spotify, and I love Autechre, and I've heard so many very good things from a lot of people I admire about how great the Spotify documentation is that it seems like an excellent place to start. This is also my first attempt at "coding in the open", a nerve-wracking prospect, but something I should probably get used to if I want to work in this field.

Expect some not too great code and some less than stellar interpretation/understanding of the things I'm doing. I'm a bit new, so if you happen to stumble over this and have some feedback then _please_ feel free to chime in and give us a hand

So, with all that in mind, let's dive in.
